Why and How We Built This Application
This application's core functionality is built on AI-powered semantic search, a more advanced method than traditional keyword search. This approach allows the system to understand the meaning and context of a workout description, not just the words it contains.

The "What" and "Why"
What we used: We leveraged two distinct types of AI models:

A transformer-based embedding model to handle the core semantic search.

A language model for content validation.

Why this method: Our goal was to create a robust system that can identify similar concepts even with different phrasing or typos. This approach is superior to keyword search because it captures the true intent behind the data. A search for a "full body workout" will successfully match "a comprehensive routine targeting all major muscle groups," which a simple text search might miss.

The "How"
AI Embeddings: When a new workout is created, its details are sent to Google's embedding-001 model. This model returns a 768-dimensional vectorâ€”a list of numbers that represents the workout's meaning. This vector is stored in our MongoDB database.

Vector Search: To check for duplicates, the new workout's vector is compared to all existing vectors in the database using MongoDB Atlas's $vectorSearch. This process efficiently finds the nearest vector by calculating the similarity between them.

Data Quality: A separate AI layer validates the spelling and grammar of the workout description. This ensures that the data used to create the embeddings is clean and accurate, improving the reliability of the entire system.

Data out bronnen:

Vector Embeddings and Semantic Search
Academic research and industry case studies consistently show that vector search is a powerful method for handling unstructured data. Studies from platforms like arXiv and ResearchGate demonstrate that transformer-based models can encode the semantic meaning of text into high-dimensional vectors. A key finding is that this approach provides a more accurate search experience by retrieving results based on conceptual similarity, not just keyword matches. This is a significant improvement over traditional methods.




Case Studies: Several papers and industry blogs detail how vector search is used in various fields. For example, in healthcare, it's used to match patient records with similar symptoms or to find relevant medical research by analyzing unstructured notes and lab reports. Another study from a company called Akvelon highlights a fitness app that uses AI to analyze and compare a user's movements to a virtual coach. While your application focuses on text, the underlying principle of using AI to understand and compare complex, unstructured data remains the same.



Metrics: Research shows that a cosine similarity score (the metric you're using) above 0.8 is a strong indicator of a semantic relationship between two documents. This validates the threshold you've set for your duplicate checker.

AI for Data Quality
Beyond semantic search, there is a separate body of research on using AI to improve data quality. Studies from institutions like MIT Sloan Management Review and various academic journals highlight the importance of "garbage in, garbage out" in AI systems.

The Problem: Poor data quality, including inconsistencies, duplicates, and errors, can lead to biased or unreliable AI models and inaccurate results.

The Solution: Researchers advocate for using AI-driven frameworks to proactively detect and correct errors in data. The use of a language model or a grammar API, as we have implemented, is a direct application of this principle. It ensures the data your embedding model processes is high-quality and consistent, which improves the overall performance of your semantic search system.
